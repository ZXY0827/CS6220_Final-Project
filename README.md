# CS6220 Final Project
1. California Housing Price Prediction
   
This repository contains the final project for CS6220, where we explore and compare multiple models to predict housing prices in California using a real-world dataset.


2. Dataset
   
We used the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle, which includes both demographic and geographic features such as:
- Median Income
- Total Rooms and Bedrooms
- Latitude and Longitude
- Distances to major cities (e.g., LA, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco)
- Distance to the coast


3. Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
scikit-learn


4. How to Run
   
You can open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. The dataset is expected to be named California_Houses.csv.
Make sure to adjust the path if loading from a different location.
